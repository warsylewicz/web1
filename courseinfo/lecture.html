## Example of a Good Question

Hi Aaron, I'm trying to center a div on the page. I've tried using `margin: 0 auto;` but the div is still on the left-side of the screen. Here's my HTML and CSS:

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>Some text</p>

etc.
```

and here's a screenshot of what it looks like:
