# Activity: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the only languages that browsers understand,
and each serves a different purpose. Understanding the role each language
plays within a webpage will help you to design efficient and maintainable
websites.

Using your knowledge of the web and with the assistance of your favourite
search engine, discuss and answer the following questions in small groups.
Be prepared to discuss your findings in class.

1. What is the role of HTML in a webpage?
2. What are two examples of HTML elements?
3. What is the role of CSS in a webpage?
4. What are two examples of CSS properties?
5. What is the role of JavaScript in a webpage?
6. What are two examples of the functionality that JavaScript can add to a
  webpage?
