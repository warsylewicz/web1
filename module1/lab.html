    <h2>Lab 0 Development Environment Setup</h2>
    <p>
      For this lab, you will be setting up your development environment which
      will allow you to implement your other labs and assignments. In many
      workplaces, you will be expected to set up your own development
      environment so this is good practice.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Part 1: Install Code Editor</h3>
    <p>
      The most common code editor for websites and web applications is Visual
      Studio Code. It is easy to install and use, light on resources (you don't
      need a powerful laptop), and the best editor for this course.
    </p>

      <li>
        In your favourite browser, navigate to
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">

        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the "Download for Windows Stable Build" button. The executable
        installer will automatically download. Wait for the download to finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the installer file. (The file is named VSCodeUserSetup-x64-[version
        number].)
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the steps of the installer. Accept all of the defaults - just
        keep clicking the "Next" button. If need more help on this step, here

          more detailed instructions</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        If all goes well, VS Code application will automatically start. You can
        delete the installer file since we don't need it anymore.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Part 2: Add Extensions to VS Code</h3>
    <p>
      Some applications allow for customizations through the use of extensions
      or add-ons by giving us additional functionality. The VS Code Marketplace
      has thousands of extensions supporting many different languages. In this
      part, we are going to install a few different extensions to make our life
      better for developing web pages with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. More
      information about
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>If VS Code isn't running, start VS Code.</li>
      <li>
        Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code to
        open up Extensions View.<br /><img
          src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/extension-marketplace/extensions-view-icon.png"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Prettier - Code formatter. The Prettier extension enforces a consistent
        style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that
        take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            In the Extensions sidebar, search for "prettier" and install
            "Prettier - Code formatter".
          </li>
          <li>
            Now let's configure Prettier. Open VS Code settings by clicking on
            File -> Preferences -> Settings. (i) Search for "Default formatter"
            and choose "Prettier - Code formatter" from the list. (ii) Search
            for "Format on Save" and check the checkbox. Close the Settings tab
            when you are done.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Live Preview. The Live Preview extension hosts a local server for you to
        preview your web projects on. This extension shows the result of your
        code right inside of VS Code so you don't have to use a browser.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            In the Extensions sidebar, search for "live preview" and install
            "Live Preview".
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are few other optional extensions that you may consider
        installing. Search for these extensions and decide for yourself if you
        want them. You can install and uninstall extensions to try them out too.
