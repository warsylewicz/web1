<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>
  This module introduces you to the basic concepts and terms you’ll need to
  develop any website. You’ll start by examining the structure of a web server
  and how clients connect to them. You’ll also explore the differences between
  front-end web development and back-end web development, as well as the
  differences between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The unit concludes with an
  examination of web standards.
